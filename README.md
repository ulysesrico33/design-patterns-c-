- I think after I started as developer, there are several ways to follow, I really love and I am very interested on ARCHIETCTURE,so I created this repo to implement disegn patterns in C#.
- So far I have been working with several design patterns without knowing about it, a great step for me would be to start knowing them and know about those patterns.

- It's really amazing, yesterday at work again I was very interested on doing something with the Registry and the main issue was that I had to design somethings so it could be mocked and tested, and to do so I had to design it properly. I learnt that was I was trying to achive is a design pattern known as **Wrapper or Adapter or Decorator**. So yes, it's official , I have a vocation for software development but not just for that but for **SOFTWARE ARCHIETCTURE**.
